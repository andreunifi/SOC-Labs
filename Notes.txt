CubeMX select MCU: NUCLE0-f401re
PA5 is the GPIO pin. LED pin => initial at low
Select another pin? Click on the mcu I/O, and chooseand option

PC13 is another gpio pin: configured as blue pushbutton.
Generate an interrupt when button is prossed
External interrupt mode, with rising edge trigger 

Interrupts have different prorities
NVIC handles interrupts: we choose EXT1	line 
HAL handler

Button is pressed => rising edge on pc13 => interrupt gets triggered EXTI_interrupt handler

call HAL EXT1 interrupt handler => custom function on callback
IRQ will call the handler, HAL handler will be called, and final callback will be executed

stm32f4xx_it.c !
IRQ HAndler for the EXTIO interrupt.  Then HAL callback is initialized

 sysbus . gpioPortA . UserLed for displaying in renode led status
 MX_TIM10_Init(); inside the main for initializing timer 0.
